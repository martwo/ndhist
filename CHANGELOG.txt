- Make the python package installation more flexible by introducing the
  ``--user`` option to the ``configure`` script. If this option is not
  specified, the python package will be installed in a directory relative to the
  ``--prefix`` option. In cases where ``--prefix`` is set to ``/usr`` or
  ``/usr/local``, the package will be installed into the system's python package
  repository.

- Developed a setuptools installation script for the Python package "ndhist", so
  it gets installed either within the ``--prefix`` directory, or into the python
  dist-packages directory located in the user's home directory under
  ``.local/``. So the user does not have to set the PYTHONPATH environment
  variable manually.

- Adapted the ndhist constructor to use a tuple of Axis objects.

- Added pybindings for GenericAxis.

- Added --boostnumpy-include-path and --boostnumpy-library-path as options
  to the configure script, which are passed on to cmake with the environment
  variables BOOSTNUMPY_INCLUDE_PATH and BOOSTNUMPY_LIBRARY_PATH, respectively.
  This way the BoostNumpy installation can be found when it is installed at a
  costum place.

- Renamed the "ndhist" python module to "core", in order to prevent name
  clashes with the future python module "ndhist" implemented in Python.
  This makes it also possible to run "make test" before "make install".

- Added first test that checks the nbins property of an axis and a ndhist
  object.

- Implemented a test facility with ctest.

- Added pybindings for the ConstantBinWidthAxis class.

- Added pybindings for the Axis class.
