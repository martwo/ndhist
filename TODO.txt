- Implement the base_ property of ndhist that refers to the ndhist object when
  the ndhist object is a view into that. This might make the owner property of
  ndarray_storage obsolete. This is actually important for object bin arrays,
  where the elements need to be deref'ed by the correct ndhist object, ie. the
  owner.

- Write unit tests for the different possibilities of filling values, i.e.
  * underflow behavior,
  * overflow behavior,
  * auto extendable axis

- Write unit tests for basic ndhist slicing.

- Implement the most up-to-date fill procedure also for a structured ndarray
  given as ndvalues object. (generic_nd_trais)

- Overwork the ndhist.extend_bin_content_array() function. There should be a
  faster way of initializing the extra bins.

- Add target "html" to the cmake build system to generate HTML documentation
  using Sphinx.
