- Implement the rebin method of the ndhist class, that can take bp::tuple
  (or vector) objects for the axis and nbins_to_merge arguments.

- Implement clear() method, that sets all bin content values to zero.

- Implement advanced slicing a la numpy.

- Write unit tests for the rebin_axis method when using extendable axes and
  also for nd >= 2.

- Write unit tests for the different possibilities of filling values, i.e.
  * underflow behavior,
  * overflow behavior,
  * auto extendable axis

- Write unit tests for basic ndhist slicing with nd>=2.

- Implement the most up-to-date fill procedure also for a structured ndarray
  given as ndvalues object. (generic_nd_traits)

- Overwork the ndhist.extend_bin_content_array() function. There should be a
  faster way of initializing the extra bins.

- Add target "html" to the cmake build system to generate HTML documentation
  using Sphinx.
