- Implement the arithmetic operation ndhist += scalar which adds an entry to all
  bins. Possible usecase would be to generate a histogram with a given offset
  (baseline).

- Write unit tests for the different possibilities of filling values, i.e.
  * underflow behavior,
  * overflow behavior,
  * auto extendable axis

- Rename full_multi_axis_index_iter to multi_axis_index_iter and adjust it to
  assume, that the given shape, already includes under- and overflow bins.

- Construct the ndarray within the py_get_noe_ndarray, py_get_sow_ndarray and
  py_get_sows_ndarray functions only for bins without the under- and overflow
  bins. This means, calculate strides and shape for only the "visible" bins.

- Implement the most up-to-date fill procedure also for a structured ndarray
  given as ndvalues object. (generic_nd_trais)

- Overwork the ndhist.extend_bin_content_array() function. There should be a
  faster way of initializing the extra bins.

- Add target "html" to the cmake build system to generate HTML documentation
  using Sphinx.
