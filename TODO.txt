- Add ValueTransform template argument to GenericAxis template.
  Create LinearGenericAxis template and Log10GenericAxis template.

- add properties "n_entries" and "n_all_entries" providing the number of total
  entries excluding and including out-of-range bins, respectively.

- Implement unit test for all the statistics utility functions.

- Implement advanced slicing a la numpy.

    Since we support only continues axis histograms, integer indexing must only
    be allowed for a contiguous axis ranges, i.e. all given indices of an axis
    must be convertible into a slice object of step 1.

- Write unit tests for the merge_axis_bins method when using extendable axes.

- Write unit tests for the different possibilities of filling values, i.e.
  * underflow behavior,
  * overflow behavior,
  * auto extendable axis

- Write unit tests for basic ndhist slicing with nd>=2.

- Overwork the ndhist.extend_bin_content_array() function. There should be a
  faster way of initializing the extra bins.

- Add target "html" to the cmake build system to generate HTML documentation
  using Sphinx.
